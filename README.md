```

**2. Change current directory to the cloned folder:**

## Firebase hosting

1. In order to add new build to Firebase hosting, follow these commands

```shell
firebase login
```
```shell
firebase init
```
2. Choose account, then choose Hosting as an option
3. Select Firebase project
4. Run:
```shell
flutter build web
```
```shell
firebase deploy
```

### Integration test
In order to run integration test you have to:
1. Use test_driver located at `test_driver/integration_test.dart`.
2. Add enviromental variables API_KEY(for google maps) and IS_TESTING through --dart-define
3. (Optional) Use shader warming up to collect shaders to `flutter_01.sksl.json`

So, to run integration test, run the following command:

Without shaders warming up
```shell
flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```

With shaders warming up

```shell
flutter drive --profile --cache-sksl --write-sksl-on-exit flutter_01.sksl.json --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```
<br>

### To build release version with shaders warming up use the following:
Android
```shell
flutter build apk --bundle-sksl-path flutter_01.sksl.json
```
iOS
```shell
flutter build ios --bundle-sksl-path flutter_01.sksl.json
```
